#Finger Counting
README


This project is on the topic of finger counting in realtime with openCv
Important python libraries used in the above code are OpenCV and mediapipe.

Aim- To detect finger counting in realtime and display the number of fingers raised.

CODING:
Window design:
The main concept of using mediapipe is that mediapipe is a cross-platform library developed by Google that provides amazing ready-to-use ML solutions for computer vision tasks. OpenCV on the otherhand,is a tool for image analysis, webcam output, image processing, detection and face recognition.

 Was able to do this for upto 5 fingers uptill which it gets confused with the hand type of tips.
